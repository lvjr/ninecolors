\RequirePackage{xcolor}
\RequirePackage{xparse}

%% Old version of l3color doesn't work if the colon has catcode letter.
%% See https://github.com/latex3/latex3/issues/962
%% and https://github.com/lvjr/ninecolors/issues/1
%% But we need to make ninecolors package support TeX Live 2020,
%% because tabularray still supports TeX Live 2020 and it depends on this package.
%% Therefore we can not use \ProvidesExplPackage in the above code,
%% and we need to put color data before \ExplSyntaxOn/\ExplSyntaxOff block.
